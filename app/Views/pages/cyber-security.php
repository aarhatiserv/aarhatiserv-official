          <strong>What is cyber security</strong>
        </h3>
        <p class="p-5 text-left">
          Cybersecurity is the system of defending systems, networks, and
          applications from cyber-attacks. These attacks on IT
          infrastructure are usually aimed at assessing, modifying, or
          damaging delicate information; forcing money from users, or
          disrupting regular business methods. Internet attacks are an
          evolving threat to corporations, employees and customers. They
          may be created to obtain or damage delicate information or
          extract funds. These can ruin companies and corrupt their
          economic and individual lives.

          <strong>Why it is necessery</strong>
        </h3>
        <p class="p-5 text-left">
          Cybersecurity is essential because it includes everything that
          concerns protecting delicate data, particularly identifiable
          information (PII), protected health information (PHI), private
          data, intelligent assets, information, and national and
          enterprise information systems from fraud and loss tried by
          crooks and opponents. Because of the huge rise in hacks and
          hacking attempts, IT security has grown an inevitable issue of
          discussion in the past few years. Incidents that happen in the
          cybersecurity activity can and frequently do have global
          consequences and the probability of fatal outcomes.
